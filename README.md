About Me
Hey! My name is Ritesh Prabhu, and I'm a current CS student at the University of Minnesota.

Now, Iâ€™m working on research at GroupLens for MovieLens, participating in startup work through the Holmes Center for Entrepreneurshipâ€™s MVP Challenge, and building new tools to support my community.
