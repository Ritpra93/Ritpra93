## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate CS student who got started by founding a computer science club in high school to help others learn programming through hands-on experimentation. Now, I'm continuing my journey at the University of Minnesota, where I:

- Research with [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/) on the MovieLens project  
- Participated in startup work through the Holmes Center for Entrepreneurship's MVP Challenge (later abandoned, however)  
- Build tools to empower my community  

I'm especially drawn to the FinTech space—solving real-world problems in data quality, financial fraud detection, scalability, and ML/AI applications.
