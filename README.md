About Me
Hey! My name is Ritesh Prabhu, and I'm a current CS student at the University of Minnesota. I first started my journey by founding a CS club at my High-school to help other students like myself create and experiment with programming in different ways. Now I'm at the University of Minnesota, working on research at Group Lens for Movie Lens, working on startup work through Holmes Center of Entrepreneurship through MVP challenge, and creating new ways to help my community. I've always loved the Fintech side of things and aspire to create solutions to current problems in the space related to Data Quality, Financial Fraud detection, Scalability, or ML/AI related challenges in the space. My top 5 skills fall under doing full stack working related to React, Express.js, MongoDB, Typescript, etc. And passion for working with Python challenges related to Machine Learning through different libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. I want to continue learning, empowering, and helping others in my community. 

Iâ€™m especially passionate about the FinTech space, focused on solving challenges related to data quality, financial fraud detection, scalability, and ML/AI.
