Ritesh Prabhu | Computer Science Student at the University of Minnesota
Hey! My name is Ritesh Prabhu, and I'm a current CS student at the University of Minnesota. I first started my journey by founding a CS club at my high school to help other students like myself create and experiment with programming in different ways. Now I'm at the University of Minnesota, working on research at GroupLens for MovieLens, participating in startup work through the Holmes Center of Entrepreneurship's MVP challenge, and creating new ways to help my community. I've always loved the Fintech side of things and aspire to create solutions to current problems in the space related to Data Quality, Financial Fraud detection, Scalability, or ML/AI related challenges in the space. My top 5 skills are related to full-stack development, specifically working with React, Express.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, and other technologies. And a passion for working with Python challenges related to Machine Learning through different libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. I want to continue learning, empowering, and helping others in my community.
